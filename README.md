Practice with more JavaScript topics

This is a website that lets you play a vanilla tic-tac-toe game?

## About

You can play a two player game with player one being X by clicking one time, and player two being O by clicking twice. It has a button to check to see if you win and a reset button to clear the board. I've recently learned more about more javascript. So I implemented another eventListener and added a for loop into the the reset button.

## Built With
